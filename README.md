# Team IOTA

Run the following to install all necessary files:
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install webcolors
$ pip install pyttsx3

Note: use the webcolors.py file provided in this repo to change your webcolors to be more readable.
Search "webcolors.py" in your file explorer, then open it using IDEAL to edit
(Just copy->paste the entire file instead of changing the names again, I already did all the work)
